# ![Demo](/resources/vx_logo_v1.png?raw=true) VoronoiX (IN DEV) 

__VoronoiX__ (or VX) - __C++__ library, with __JS__ interface on 
top of it, that allows to work with different data structures and 
algorithms related to Voronoi diagram, Delaunay triangulation and 
other geometric structures.

### GIFs
Convex hull of points randomly distributed on sphere 
![Sphere](/resources/3d_convex.gif?raw=true)
Convex hull of points projected from a plane onto a paraboloid. 
The edges of this convex hull corresponds to the edges of Delaunay triangulation 
on 2D plane.
