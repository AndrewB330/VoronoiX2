# ![Demo](/resources/vx_logo_v1.png?raw=true) VoronoiX (IN DEV) 

__VoronoiX__ (or VX) - __C++__ library, with __JS__ interface on 
top of it, that allows to work with different data structures and 
algorithms related to Voronoi diagram, Delaunay triangulation and 
other geometric structures. 

### Features
- [x] __QHull__ algorithm (k-dimensional convex hull)
- [x] Intersection of half-spaces (using plane-point duality: 
[blog](https://11011110.github.io/blog/2011/03/16/halfspace-intersections-and.html),
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)
)

Convex hull of points projected from a plane onto a paraboloid. 
The edges of this convex hull corresponds to the edges of Delaunay triangulation 
on 2D plane.
